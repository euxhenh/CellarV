# Spatial
{: .no_toc }

Spatial proteomics has become a useful tool for visualizing the locations
of proteins and their dynamics at the cellular level. The spatial data panel
is useful for visualizing these spatial locations for CODEX and
Visium 10x Genomics spatial transcriptomics data.
Additional files containing spatial information have to
be uploaded. These files have already been uploaded to Cellar for all
the server datasets.
