# Spatial Tile
{: .no_toc }

This panel was originally built to support
[CODEX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6086938/) data and was
later expanded to include
[Visium 10x](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-gene-expression).
These use different formats for constructing the spatial image.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

1. *CODEX*

    For CODEX we accept image data produced by
    [cytokit](https://github.com/hammerlab/cytokit). You will need the following:

    1. **Segmented images**

        These are `.tif` files named
        `R001_X00\*_Y00\*.tif` where the asterix
        character specifies the x and y coordinates of the tile
        (starting from 1). These images should have shape
        (z-planes, 4, height, width) where the 4 axis show:

        1. the cell segmentations filled,
        2. nucleus segmentation filled,
        3. cell segmentation outlines,
        4. nucleus segmentation outlines

        Each pixel in these segmented images
        will either have value 0, denoting no cell,
        or the value of the cell ID.

    2. **A `data.csv` file**

        This file contains information output from Cytokit. Each row
        represents a cell, and the column `rid` gives the cell index
        in the `.h5ad` file.
        The column `id` gives the cell ID for that specific tile. The column `z`
        gives which z-plane in which that particular tile has the best focus,
        and columns `'tile_x'` and `'tile_y'` give the coordinates of the tile
        for that cell.

    A folder named `images` containing the tiff files and the `data.csv` file
    need to be compressed into a `.tar.gz`
    file and uploaded to Cellar in the spatial panel.

    Generating the tile will color each cell by its cluster.

    Furthermore, tiles can also be colored by protein expression

2. *Visium 10x Spatial Transcriptomics*

    For 10X spatial data, simply upload the spatial related files
    generated by [spaceranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/output/images).

    Also colored by gene expression
