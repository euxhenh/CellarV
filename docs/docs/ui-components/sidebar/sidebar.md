# Sidebar
{: .no_toc }

The sidebar consists of five panels. The first two deal with dimensionality
reduction and clustering - two important steps when analyzing single cell
data. The third panel is used to store annotations (cell types) for every
cluster. The fourth and the fifth contain general tools such as subset
and session management.
