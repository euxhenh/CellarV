This button allows the user to switch between dual/single mode. In dual mode, two datasets can be visualized simultaneously for side-by-side comparison. 


* **<span class='mbutton'>DUAL MODE</span>**
    * This will split the main plot into two parts, each for one dataset. The user can use the <span class='mbutton'>ACTIVATE</span> buttons to activate one of the datasets and deactivate the other one. All of the functions like dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differentially expressed gene analysis will only be applied to the activated plot. Panels containing the information about the dataset (e.g. DE analysis results) will only show information for the activated dataset. The deactivated one temporarily comes merely a stationary visualization but all the analysis results are stored and will be recovered once it is activated again.  

* **<span class='mbutton'>SINGLE MODE</span>**
    * This will expand the activated plot and get back to single mode. But the session for the other dataset will not be lost. It can be recovered once enter the dual mode again.
